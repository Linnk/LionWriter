{"name":"Lionwriter","tagline":"Another hipster static content manager. Based on Medium, written on PHP.","body":"# Lion Writer project.\r\n\r\nLion Writer is a static content management for hipster hackers and/or anyone who hates Wordpress —or similar software— enough to learn this “pure” style of writting.\r\n\r\nAnd I just realize that it works great for documentation sites!\r\n\r\nThere is other systems like [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) written on Ruby or [Pelican](https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican) written on Python. These are great static blog generators and those are great languages (very popular on the hacker community, unlike PHP), but a lot of us we actually have at least one or several servers running the old and good Apache/PHP.\r\n\r\nThe next steps are Dropbox integration and create a nice portrait page. If you notice that the design is inspired from **Medium** and you have taste for *user* *interfaces*, give me a hand to make it better. :)","google":"UA-222275-11","note":"Don't delete this file!
