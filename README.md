# Lion Writer project.

I'm developing a content management system for hipster hackers and anyone who hates to use Wordpress or similar software.

There is other systems like [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) written on Ruby or [Textmate](https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican) written on Python. These are great static blog generators and those are great languages (very popular on the hacker community, unlike PHP), but a lot of us we actually have at least one or several servers running the old and good Apache/PHP.

The next steps are Dropbox integration and create a nice portrait page. If you notice that this design it is inspired from **Medium** and you have taste for *user* *interfaces*, give me a hand to make it better. :)
