# LionWriter

LionWriter is a static content management for hipster hackers and anyone who also think Wordpress is too much for something that should be simpler. This is a file-based CMS.

## Philosophy

- Databases are too mainstream.
- WYSIWYG editor? We rather not.
- Awesome for git.
- Easy to install (drag and drop).
- KISS principle.
- Themes support.

## Getting Started

## Alternatives

There are alternatives like [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) or [Pelican](https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican). These are great static blog generators written in great programming languages, but a lot of us have at least one or several servers running the old and good Apache/PHP. So, what the heck!

Update.
