Databases are too mainstream.

This is a static content management for hipster hackers and/or anyone who hates Wordpress —or similar— enough.

WYSIWYG editor? We rather not. VIM is so more vintage.

Other systems like [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), which is written on Ruby and there is [Pelican](https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican), written on Python. These are great static blog generators and those are great languages (very popular on the hacker community), but a lot of us have at least one or several servers running the old and good Apache/PHP. So, what the heck.

The first time I tried to mimic the *Medium* design, but now I think this will be usefull for documentation websites, so I'm making the necessary changes.
